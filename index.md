# Kenku Warlock - Chaotic Neutral

## Warlock Class Features

### Patron: Great Old One

Awakened Mind - Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

### Pact of the Tome

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

## Background

Purchased as a nestling by a mage's guild for 100 gp, Skribble was trained to copy all manner of writings, but not to read them. Involuntarily employed as the guild's scribe, he was effectively held captive in the library throughout childhood. Guild magic and manipulation ensured his subservience.

In spring of his seventeenth year, the guild archaeologists returned from a distant expedition with an ancient, powerful book. Attempts to decipher it ended tragically, as readers became stricken with an ineffable madness. Deemed expendable following the gruesome death of the archmage, Skribble was tasked with copying the cursed book.

Though he could not read the runes he feverishly wrote, flickers and hints of meaning nonetheless began to invade his perception and memory. Slowly at first, he began to imagine psychic whispers promising a path to freedom, as he sat copying gibberish for days without end. In the night of the 13th day, in a state between dream and delirium, Skribble spoke a reply into the void. His mind awakened, and Skribble became suffused with the alien magic of a slumbering Old God from beyond the far realms.

The psychic wake of this cosmic passing crashed over the library and spilled out into the surrounding reality, warping the very minds of the mages. Bloody pandemonium ensued throughout the guild campus as violent insanity gripped the scholars and staff. By daybreak, Skribble stood among the smoldering ruins, sole survivor of the only home he had ever known.

Bearing the book and subconciously guided by whispers from beyond perception, Skribble ventured out into the world.
