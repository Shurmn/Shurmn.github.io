## Kenku Warlock

# Background
Purchased as a nestling by a mage's guild for 100 gp, Skribble was trained to copy all manner of writings, but not to read them. Involuntarily employed as the guild's scribe, he was effectively held captive in the library throughout childhood. Guild magic and manipulation ensured his subservience.

In spring of his seventeenth year, the guild archaeologists returned from a distant expedition with an ancient, powerful book. Attempts to decipher it ended tragically, as readers became stricken with an ineffable madness. Deemed expendable following the gruesome death of the archmage, Skribble was tasked with copying the cursed book.

Though he could not read the runes he feverishly wrote, flickers and hints of meaning nonetheless began to invade his perception and memory. Slowly at first, he began to imagine psychic whispers promising a path to freedom, as he sat copying gibberish for days without end. In the night of the 13th day, in a state between dream and delirium, Skribble spoke a reply into the void. His mind awakened, and Skribble became suffused with the alien magic of a slumbering Old God from beyond the far realms.

The psychic wake of this cosmic passing crashed over the library and spilled out into the surrounding reality, warping the very minds of the mages. Bloody pandemonium ensued throughout the guild campus as violent insanity gripped the scholars and staff. By daybreak, Skribble stood among the smoldering ruins, sole survivor of the only home he had ever known.

Bearing the book and subconciously guided by whispers from beyond perception, Skribble ventured out into the world.
